## Documentation Style Preferences

When creating README files and project documentation:

1. **Research-Focused Approach**: Write documentation like a technical paper or whitepaper, not just simple usage docs

2. **Include Academic Sections**:
   - Abstract summarizing the contribution
   - Introduction with problem statement
   - Related Work comparing with existing solutions
   - System Architecture with diagrams
   - Technical Design sections (cryptographic design, protocol specs, etc.)
   - Evaluation/Security analysis
   - Future Work
   - References section

3. **Add Citations**: Include numbered academic references [1], [2], etc. covering:
   - Foundational papers (e.g., Nakamoto for blockchain)
   - Cryptographic primitives (Bernstein for Ed25519, ChaCha20)
   - Related systems and protocols
   - Standards and RFCs

4. **Use Mermaid Diagrams**: Include visual diagrams for:
   - Architecture overview
   - Data/message flows (sequence diagrams)
   - Component relationships

5. **Tables for Comparisons**: Use tables to compare:
   - Your system vs related work
   - Security properties and mechanisms
   - Current vs future capabilities

6. **Security Analysis**: Include threat model and mitigations table

7. **Keep It Professional**: Format like an academic paper while remaining practical documentation
